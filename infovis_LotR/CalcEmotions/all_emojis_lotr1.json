            " It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves immortal, wisest ... fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And Nine ... nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived. ...for another Ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others. ...and into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all... One by one the Free lands of Middle earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some ... who resisted. A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor. On the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth. Victory was near! But the power of the Ring could not be undone. It was in this moment ... when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur ... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten ... were lost. Thus a Third Age of Middle Earth began. History became legend ... legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The Ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave... It waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the East ... whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived ... its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend... It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable... A Hobbit ... Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.",

Whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly! They spent so long arguing the whither to's and why for's that the sun's first light cracked over the top of the trees ... and turned them all to stone! Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you! Welcome, welcome. Are all these children yours? Good gracious, you have been productive. Sackville Bagginses! Quickly! Hide! Thank you, my boy. You're a good lad, Frodo. I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am ... very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think ... it was because, of all my numerous relations ... you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit. No. Well, yes. But that's not the point. The point is, Frodo ... you'll be all right. Dragon? Nonsense ... hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years! My dear Bagginses and Boffins, Tooks and Brandybucks ...

Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday. I am eleventy one today! Yes, and alas ... Eleventy one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits! I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve! I have ... things to do and I have put this off for far too long.

I can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieve Mountains, and draws nigh even to the borders of the Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; but so perilous have the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or come no quicker than you yourself. Had I a host of Elves in armor of the Elder Days, it would avail little, save to arouse the power of Mordor. Are you confident in your companions? And what of your Hobbit friends? I had hoped to send them back to the Shire as messengers to warn the people of the impending danger according to the fashion of your country.

Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment ... even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it ... and that is an encouraging thought.
